            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Alſo, our Saviour added; that they could not come to him, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he went, <hi>John.</hi> 13. 33. &amp; made their ſtate, in that point, as the common Jewes: &amp; upon <hi>Peters</hi> reply, &amp; his anſwer; which had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: <hi>verſe.</hi> 36: that he ſhould come afterward to him; he yet foretells his fall, which might hinder his comming to Chriſt afterwards, <hi>John</hi> 13. 36. 37. 38.</p>
               <p>Yea, and that they <hi>all</hi> ſhould be offended becauſe of him, <hi>(as Mark:</hi> 14. 27) Now theſe things began to trouble their hearts, with feare &amp; greife: wherefore Our Saviour ſpeakes to them, theſe words of my text, <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled.</hi>

Now, its an exceſſe of affection, and an in ordinacy, a ſurfet, or drunkonnes of heart; when the heart is ſo taken with a feare or greife, as that it cannot give its due to every one; and doe its duty in every kind to God &amp; man, in the calling generall, and perticular.</p>
               <p>This was an inordinacy, <hi>Jn exceſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Partly there was an inordinacy in the <hi>Object;</hi> in that they fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp; greived about what they needed not: For though they might be troubled, at Chriſts departure, as he was a man, and their friend, companion, maiſter; &amp;c: [a good ground for a <hi>morrall</hi> greife] &amp; as he was their Jeſus: [a good ground for a <hi>Spirituall</hi> greife; in that they loved him, and ſo, his preſence] Yet there was no ground, or cauſe to feare a <hi>loſſe,</hi> by his departure, or that they ſhould be now total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left to the wide world; as if, all their ſafety, and comfort had bin entailed to his bodily preſence; this trouble on wronge grounds and cauſes, he forbids: (as we ſhall ſee more fully heere after.)</p>
               <p>So that, the meaning of this charge of Chriſt; is: that they ſhould not be troubled with more feares, or greifes, then there was true ground, and cauſe for,; nor yet be ſo troubled with what was truely, as to hinder the exerciſe of their peace, hope, and faith; or to be ſo oppreſt, as unfitted to every duty to God; and man, in their call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings gennerall; and perticular: All which: we may expreſſe in this: <hi>An oppreſſing or perplexing trouble:</hi> Hence: Learne:</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>There cannot be weaker Faith, then this of the diſciples; who had indeed, ſome little faith: but ſo little, as, ſometime, it is called none: <hi>(Math:</hi> 8. 26. with <hi>Marke.</hi> 4. 40) &amp; therefore Chriſt, did after wards, upbraid them for their ſlownes to beleeve <hi>(Luke.</hi> 24. 25.) There cannot be a greater affliction; change, or loſſe; befall any, then this was: For Chriſt, was to be taken from them by a ſhamefull death; when they had enjoyed him but about three yeares, and ſome months; Now, what feares, of falls, &amp; troubles, might they have, when Chriſt was taken from them, who was to them, more then an <hi>hen,</hi> to new <hi>hatcht chickins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe they had one of twelve, of them, proved, a vile &amp; rotten hyppocrite, who yet had ſo lurkt, as that they could never diſcover him.</p>
                  <p>Alſo, they had uppon them the guilte of much unfruitfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes under Chriſts miniſtry, for which he had oft reproved them.</p>
                  <p>Alſo, they had either now, or preſently after, the breaking forth of a baſe luſt of pride, &amp; ambition, for which, Chriſt had oft reproved them: Yet at the <hi>paſſeover</hi> &amp; inſtitution of the <hi>Lords ſupper;</hi> they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly fell into it againe: <hi>Luke.</hi> 22. 24.</p>
                  <p>Alſo, Chriſt had foretold them of a great, &amp; fowle ſinne, for the future; which, afterwards, the ſtouteſt of them, ſhould commit: namely <hi>Peter,</hi> to deny him thrice: Yea, &amp; all of them, to be offended at him (as ye heard before) Behould, a concurrency of all, at once, as can befall any beleever: a weake faith, an unparraleld loſſe, and change: unfruitfullnes under meanes which were now to be remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, many ſinnes formerly committed, &amp; ſharpely reproved: a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne &amp; relapſe into the ſame ſinne againe, at preſent; a foreſight, of a dangerous fall into a greivous ſinne, in the future: a diſcovery at preſent, of a moſt cloſe hyppocrite among themſelves, of whome none of them had the leaſt ſuſpition more then of themſelves; Yet, Chriſt chargeth them not to be oppreſt, or perplext in heart, with any feare or greife: Thus: <hi>Gen:</hi> 45. 5. though their ſinne, in ſelling <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was very hanious conteining profaines, For they hated him for his goodnes <hi>Gen:</hi> 37. 2, and envy, becauſe of his Fathers love, &amp; <hi>Gods</hi>

                  <p>Which is implied, in theſe words <hi>(Let not your hearts be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled)</hi> Is; that <hi>beleevers</hi> put themſelves under the command, &amp; ſet it before them. &amp; labor with themſelves, to keepe from the trouble of heart forbid: So much, Chriſt implies; when he layes the command before them; ſaying, be not troubled.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gods words</hi> are <hi>operative</hi> aſwell as <hi>imparative:</hi> they carry a power to doe that, which they command <hi>beleevers:</hi> as in the Creation: <hi>let there</hi>

                     <hi>be light, &amp; there was light;</hi> and though it is God which helpes, Yet he will have <hi>beleevers</hi> beſtir themſelves; he helpes in &amp; by, their putting forth themſelves <hi>[up &amp; be doing, &amp; the Lord will be with you]</hi> For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers have an underſtanding; &amp; a will; &amp; a principle of grace; which God will have improved, that none of his gifts may be in vaine; &amp; in the uſe of them, he comes in: he is the <hi>Creator,</hi> &amp; applies himſelfe to every creature according to its nature, ſo as to improve and not to deſtroy it.</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:113053:8"/>
                  <p> Wherfore he helpes reaſonable creatures in &amp; by their uſe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon &amp; will; and Grace by the exerciſe of Grace: Wherefore beleevers, muſt beſtir themſelves to keepe of, &amp; get of, <hi>trouble</hi> of heart: Ye muſt not, as ſome in an ague, who when the fitt is comming, run to the fire, drinke, ſtretch themſelves, &amp; help on the fitt; but ye muſt ſhake of ſloth, &amp; ſtriue againſt it; truſt not to your owne indevors, but yet indevor: Conſider &amp; provoke your ſelves.</p>

                  <p>Which is alſo implied: (in the latter part of the firſt <hi>verſe,</hi> &amp; in the following <hi>verſes;)</hi> being indeed, the general ſcope &amp; ſumme of them all: <hi>is to gather up &amp; preſent to our judgments, grounds</hi> of comfort, which are ſtronger then the grounds of our preſent trouble; For it is comfort, that is the onely Antidote againſt trouble, joy may be with out trouble, as a well about a citty, though there be noe enemy: But comfort ſuppotteth and guards againſt trouble, as a bulwarke doth againſt an enemy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Comfort by the holy Ghoſt, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately What</note>Now nothing can comfort the heart but it is either through a ſence, by a preſence; as when the huſband preſent, comforts the wife who is in ſome trouble; Now thus to comfort beleevers, is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate worke of the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> &amp; his preſence; it is not any worke of the beleever:</p>

                  <p> Thus Chriſt, layes before his diſciples, diverſe grounds of ſtronger comfort; then they had any of <hi>trouble:</hi> as <hi>Himſelfe, (beleeve</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in me)</hi> that is in his perſon, merrits, &amp;c. <hi>verſe</hi> 1.

                  <head>THIRD MEANES. <note place="margin">3. <hi>Meanes expreſt:</hi> Is to beleeve in Chriſt as, in God.</note>
                  </head>
                  <p>Which is expreſſed in the text; <hi>Is to beleeve in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which is illuſtrated by its antecedent, &amp; preparative: <hi>their beleeving in God;</hi> this is expreſſe in the text; wherefore we will inſiſt on it more largly: and firſt explaine its meaning: Ye doe <hi>beleeve</hi> in God: (the indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive moode) &amp; doe <hi>ye beleeve in me</hi> (for the word may be indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or imparative) for, if it were both imparative: he would repeate <note place="margin">To explaine it:</note> the word <hi>(beleeve)</hi> but once: &amp; ſo if both were imparative; &amp; it is an <hi>hebraiſme:</hi> in the firſt part: a particle of ſimilitude is underſtood: as ye <hi>beleeve</hi> in the <hi>Father</hi> ſo doe it in <hi>me,</hi> as <hi>verſe.</hi> 19. I live, and ye ſhall, that is; as I doe: ye ſhall. He directs them to <hi>beleeve</hi> in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as they did in God; not ſo much, in reſpect to himſelfe, as his due, &amp; their duty to him, (though it be ſo) but in reſpect to them, as aſpecial meanes &amp; helpe to them, againſt trouble: As, if he ſhould ſay <hi>though ye beleeve in God,</hi> &amp; that will helpe you ſome what, againſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: yet proceed to <hi>beleeve in me</hi> alſo, for this will helpe you much more: Now by <hi>beleeving in God;</hi> he meanes, the <hi>Father,</hi> not exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith in Chriſt: as by <hi>beleeving in Chriſt:</hi> he excluds not faith in <note place="margin">Beleeving in God, What.</note> God the Father, &amp; holy Ghoſt alſo: but by <hi>beleeving in God: the Father</hi> is ment: the faith they had before Chriſts incarnation; which is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beleeving in God the <hi>Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt becauſe though; they had ſome knowledge of, &amp; reſpect to, the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> yet it was ſo darke, &amp; with ſuch want of diſtinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg <note place="margin">why ment of faith, before the incarnation</note> of him, as that it may be counted, as if they had not knowne <hi>him,</hi> but <hi>God onely,</hi> therefore the diſciples hitherto, were ſaid to have <hi>askt nothing in his name;</hi> they did not underſtand ſo much of him; ſo, their Faith was rather in God, then in him, <hi>For how could they</hi>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:113053:9"/> 
                     <hi>beleeve in him, of whome they had not heard?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly becauſe till Chriſt, did come, &amp; finiſh the worke: he was but the <hi>Fathers promiſe;</hi> &amp; ſo the faith which lookt on him, was foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onely on God the Father, inaſmuch, as there was nothing of Chriſt, but God the Fathers promiſe: and ſo, it is fitly called, a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving in God.</p>

Before we beleeved in God the Father, who promiſed a <hi>Redeemer</hi> ſhould come; but now we beleeve in Chriſt, who is come, &amp; hath <hi>redeemed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now theſe diſciples, are directed to beleeve in Chriſt; not, becauſe they had not at all, done it yet; for they had faith in Chriſt before now: but becauſe, as yet; their knowledg of, &amp; ſaith in Chriſt; was but darke, &amp; weake: they had but ſlender &amp; general knowledg and faith of <hi>him:</hi> Wherefore they are directed to increaſe their knowledg and ſaith in Chriſt; as a meanes to keepe them from <hi>trouble</hi> of heart:</p>
                  <p>So that one notable meanes to fence the heart <hi>againſt trouble;</hi> is faith: For though it is reaſon which by diſcourſe comforts &amp; ſo cures <note place="margin">Faith a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table means againſt trou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble &amp; how.</note> trouble (as ye heard before) Yet it is Faith which preſents to reaſon, thoſe grounds of comfort; Without faith, reaſon oft cannot ſee any grounds ſo ſtrong, as thoſe of trouble; but Faith ſhewes them: as that <note place="margin">It preſents grounds of Comfort.</note> which the eye, cannot ſee, being far of; a proſpective glaſſe, ſhewes plainely: Wherefore the <hi>comfort</hi> which <hi>beleevers</hi> had by diſcourſe, it is called <hi>the act of faith Heb.</hi> 11. 17. 19. 24. 26.</p>
                  <p>Now ſaith preſents greater things then any of thoſe which trouble us: It preſents Gods being our God; his eternal love; his ordering all <note place="margin">greater then any of Trouble</note> things for the beſt: his kingdome &amp; glory, <hi>as ours,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 16. 17. 18. though theſe things be abſent &amp; far of, yet faith makes them Preſent, and nigh: (as a proſpective glaſſe doth) &amp; it ſhewes them, in their life &amp; glory, by their owne proper colours &amp; ſhewe: and not as in a picture: For it ſhewes them <hi>in a glaſſe:</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. in which, we ſee a thing by a preſence with &amp; by its owne ſpecies &amp; colours, though <note place="margin">With the beſt veiw.</note> not directly but by reflection; Whereas in a picture; wee ſee not a thing preſent, nor its life, nor by its owne, but by other colours and ſpecies; Wherefore, as a thing ſeene in a glaſſe, affects more, then
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:113053:9"/> ſeene in a picture; So Faith ſhewes the moſt glorious things, moſt gloriouſly: &amp; ſo exceeds all grounds of trouble.</p>
                  <p>Againe: faith ſhewes things, with more certainty, then any thing <note place="margin">Moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty.</note> elce can; Reaſon, and Sence may be deceived, becauſe grounded on man; and Satan oft deceives them both: He deceived <hi>Eves</hi> reaſon in <note place="margin">Faith in Chriſt gives the ſtrongeſt grounds of comfort, For divers Reaſons.</note> innocency (for ſhe is ſaid, <hi>to be beguild)</hi> becauſe ſhe fled not to faith: But faith is grounded on God, &amp; ſo, is as ſure as God is: Wherefore nothing can give ſuch ſtrong grounds of comfort, as Faith: and no faith, like faith in Jeſus Chriſt: And that for theſe <hi>Reaſons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FIRST, Becauſe it gives more boldnes towards God, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Becauſe it gives more boldnes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God.</note> 3. 12. the word tranſlated boldnes, ſignifies an appearing in glorious liberty, lifting up the face &amp; having liberty of ſpeech &amp; an undanted or open &amp; uncovered face. as 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. not onely as oppoſite to <hi>Moſes</hi> under the <hi>Law,</hi> whoſe face was covered, to ſhew obſcurity and hiddennes of his <hi>Miniſtry:</hi> or oppoſite to convicted perſons, whoſe faces are covered for ſhame, but alſo it is oppoſite to that abaſhment which is in holy <hi>Angels. Iſa:</hi> 6. 2. 3. expreſt by <hi>covering their faces,</hi> and all this becauſe they have <hi>acceſſe</hi> or a <hi>manuduction</hi> by Chriſt, he leades them by the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to God, &amp; therefore they come with all boldnes, whereas <hi>Adam</hi> was ſhut out of <hi>Paridiſe</hi> &amp; <hi>Iſraell</hi> at <hi>Sinai</hi> ſtood afarr off, &amp; trembled, but beleevers by Chriſt come nigh with boldnes, &amp; faith in Chriſt gives this boldnes upon theſe Sixe grounds. <note place="margin">Upon ſixe grounds.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, It preſents them <hi>nearer</hi> to God; in that they by Faith, are <note place="margin">1. By it thers near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to God.</note> made one with Chriſt, who is Gods natural Sonne, &amp; ſo they come to a nearer Sonnſhip, then is obtained onely by <hi>Adoption</hi> or <hi>Creation:</hi> which the <hi>Angels</hi> have; &amp; <hi>Adam</hi> had in innocency; as a woman married to a <hi>Kings</hi> natural Sonne, is in a nearer relation, then one onely adopted; becauſe ſhe is one with his natural ſonne: thus, <hi>John.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>prerogative to be Gods ſonnes,</hi> By faith in Chriſt, may be ment, that they have a nearer ſonnſhip, then any that are created, or barely adopted (though beleevers be alſo adopted, &amp; regenerated) becauſe they be one with him who is Gods natural Sonne: Thus by faith in Chriſt; we are nearer in relation to God, &amp; ſo have more boldnes: For it is nearenes of relation, which gives boldnes: A Sonne is bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then a Servant, &amp; a lawfull Sonne then a Baſtard.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, faith in Chriſt, preſents God, nearer to them: For it <note place="margin">2. By it God is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held in their owne nature</note> ſhewes them God in their owne nature; God whome they may <hi>ſee, heare, handle,</hi> 1 <hi>John.</hi> 1. 1. 2. And ſo they may be more familiar and bold: For it is likenes, or nearenes of nature which make bold.</p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:113053:10"/>
                  <p> Thirdly, By faith in Chriſt; there is hold layed on Gods <hi>Juſtice,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. By it thers hold laid on Gods Juſtice as well as on his Mercy.</note> aſwell as on his <hi>Mercy;</hi> God in Chriſt; is juſt, &amp; a juſtifier of the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: <hi>Rom:</hi> 3. 26. that is: he doth not onely declare his mercy in a free pardon of ſinne, but he alſo declares his juſtice, in a full ſatiſfaction for ſinne; Wherefore as by Chriſt, beleevers may plead with his mercy, So they may alſo with his juſtice; in that there is not onely a way opened unto mercy, but, Chriſt hath merited &amp; of juſtice pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed divine favor; for he hath ſatiſfied the Covenant of Works, both in ſuffering what was due for its tranſgreſſion, &amp; alſo in full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of its righteouſnes, &amp; all this on their behalfe, &amp; for their uſe, who beleeve in him; So that, whatever boldnes, an <hi>Angel</hi> that ſtands, can have; or <hi>Adam</hi> could have had, if he had ſtood righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, by vertue of Gods Juſtice, &amp; the Covenant of Works; all that boldnes through Chriſt, a beleever hath; becauſe the Covenant of Works, is in Chriſt, kept by him; &amp; ſo, the Lawes righteouſnes, is fullfilled in us, through Chriſt; who beleeve, &amp; ſhew our faith, by <hi>walking after the Spirrit, &amp; not after the Flesh: Rom:</hi> 8. 3. 4.</p>
                  <p>Inſomuch that beleevers in Chriſt, may appeale to Gods Juſtice, <note place="margin">It holds God by both hands.</note> aſwell as to his Mercy; and hold God by both hands, having as cleare a title to him in juſtice, as in &amp; by mercy; holding their intereſt in him, by vertue of his Juſtice &amp; the Covenant of <hi>Works,</hi> as well as by vertue of his Mercy and the covenant of <hi>Grace;</hi> for allthough to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in their owne perſons, its onely grace &amp; mercy, and juſtice with a covenant of works, cannot ſtand with a covenant of grace, &amp; mercy; Yet in a perſon of another, who undertakes for them; both may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr; he may ſatiſfie juſtice, &amp; merrit mercy: which cannot but give greate boldnes.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, By faith in Chriſt, there is an <hi>acceſſe</hi> with boldnes <hi>to Gods</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4. By it thers an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſ to Gods holynes.</note> 
                     <hi>holynes:</hi> holynes, is the brightnes, &amp; beauty of God, which dazzles the eyes of the braveſt creatures: <hi>Iſa:</hi> 6. 2. 3. the <hi>Seraphims,</hi> not onely cover their feete, becauſe they are baſe, being creatures made of nothing but they cover their faces; even their beſt excellency; which is their perfect righteouſnes according to the covenant of works; compared with Gods glorious Holynes; for therefore he is thrice called <hi>holy;</hi> not onely to ſhew <hi>Trinity of Perſons,</hi> but gloriouſnes of <hi>holynes,</hi> as <hi>Exod:</hi> 15. 11. with which <hi>holynes,</hi> their perfect righteouſnes, is abaſht; &amp; <note place="margin">Iob. 4. 18. with 15. 15 explained.</note> ſo they cover it; Wherefore <hi>Iob.</hi> 4. 18. repeated againe, <hi>Iob.</hi> 15. 15. he is ſaid to <hi>put no truſt in his Saints, or Servants;</hi> that is his <hi>holy Angels,</hi> as the next words explaine; who are by a figure called the <hi>heavens,</hi>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:113053:10"/> becauſe they are the inhabitants, of the heavens: which <hi>Angels,</hi> or heavens inhabitants, he <hi>chargeth with folly,</hi> &amp; <hi>they are impure in his ſight:</hi> Now this cannot be ment, of the Divils, who fell; both becauſe; in <hi>Chapt:</hi> 15. 15. he ſpeaks of them in the preſent tenſe; that they now are <hi>his Saints,</hi> &amp; now are, <hi>the heavens,</hi> that is inhabitants of heaven, which the Divils, now are not; As alſo, becauſe in both texts, mans baſenes, is inferd much more; in the following <hi>verſes,</hi> which implies that he ſpeakes of ſuch as are better, &amp; leſſe impure then men; which Divels are not: For the conceiving this therefore: Conſider that all-though <note place="margin">For the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of which, Conſider.</note> God hath tyed himſelfe by a covenant of works, to accept of, and reward, ſuch a righteouſnes, as ſhall fully anſwer that covenant; which righteouſnes is found in <hi>Angels,</hi> and they are accepted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded in juſtice, according to the compact twixt God and them; ſo that, not in juſtice, or diſpeaſure, doth God find them impure, or charg them with folly: Yet the Holynes of God: which is an attribute <note place="margin">What holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in God is.</note> by which God, ſeperates himſelfe from every thing elſe, &amp; is devoted to himſelfe, to ſeeke himſelfe, &amp; love himſelfe above all (for holynes is a ſeparation from all other things with a dedication to ſome one thing) this Holynes of God, was not ſatiſfied in the righteouſnes of the covenant of works, which was in <hi>Angels,</hi> but deſired an higher righteouſnes; even ſuch an one, which might be Gods owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, <note place="margin">Which was not ſatiſfied in Angels.</note> a righteouſnes done by one that ſhould be God, aſwell as a creature, that ſo, a meere creature ſhould not boaſt, but God might have the glory, &amp; be the worker of that righteouſnes, &amp; ſo, it might taſt full to his pallet, inaſmuch as himſelfe was in it, the worker of it, in a created nature, joyned to the God-head; which is in Jeſus Chriſt; <note place="margin">But is in Chriſt.</note>
                  </p>

                  <p>Now, this is not called a purpoſe, for that, one may take up in himſelfe, without another; but a promiſe; which ever ſuppoſeth another diſtinct perſon: which was the ſecond perſon in <hi>Trinitye,</hi> to whome the Father promiſed; that he becomming <hi>incarnate,</hi> ſhould inherrit ſuch and ſuch things; and though his <hi>incarnation</hi> through which he was to inherrit all; were not in act, from everlaſting; yet in as much as his <hi>perſon</hi> was, which was to be <hi>incarnate;</hi> the promiſe might be made to him, but could not be made to any creature, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as it was not a perſon ſubſiſting from eternitye: but now; though the promiſes be all his, &amp; made onely to him in the firſt place, and ranke; yet, through &amp; by him, they deſcend alſo to others; ſo <note place="margin">Yet to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers alſo but, in him.</note> that, though they be onely to him, in the firſt place; yet they are not onely for him: as the promiſes to <hi>Abraham, &amp; David;</hi> were not onely for them, but for them, &amp; their ſeede: and the promiſes which <hi>Iſaac</hi> was indowed with, &amp; were onely in him; were not onely for him, but for him &amp; his ſeede; but yet they were their ſeeds by deſcent.</p>
                  <p>And in the Second place; even ſo, the promiſes are not onely for Chriſt, but for <hi>him,</hi> and <hi>his;</hi> namely all the <hi>Elect,</hi> whome God
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:113053:12"/> choſe in <hi>him,</hi> &amp; gave to <hi>him</hi> to be his ofſpring, &amp; ſpowſe; &amp; ſo through and from him to be indowed with all the riches of the promiſes: though God loved, &amp; choſe them all, to injoy the promiſes, yet in Chriſt, &amp; through, by, &amp; for him, to inherit; <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 4. he did not chooſe us, with him, but <hi>in him:</hi> Wherefore, as the <hi>Iſralits</hi> muſt come to enjoy the promiſes, not by laying hold firſt on them, but by being <hi>Firſt borne</hi> of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> &amp; having that union of fleſh, with him: And as a woman hath right to the mans eſtate, not immediately, but by being firſt made one with him: even ſo, muſt people be firſt of Chriſt, married to him, borne of him, drawne out of his loynes: which is <hi>by beleeving.</hi> (therefore borne of God, &amp; beleeving, are conjoyned <hi>John.</hi> 1. 12. 13.) before they can lay hold of, or claime title to, any promiſe.</p>
                  <p>For, as the Covenant of Works was made with <hi>Adam;</hi> &amp; in, &amp; <note place="margin">The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of grace made with Chriſt, and in him, to his leede.</note> through him, with thoſe who came out of him: So the Covenant of Grace, is made with Chriſt (therefore called the <hi>Second Adam)</hi> &amp; in, &amp; through him, with all that come out of him, &amp; by faith are borne of him: and it is more neceſſary to be firſt made one with Chriſts perſon, before we can have claime to the promiſes: then it was to be one with, &amp; of <hi>Adam,</hi> before we could inherite from him; becauſe the promiſes of Grace, are more confind firſt to Chriſts perſon, &amp; that without the perſon of the <hi>Elect:</hi> then the Covenant of Works, was to <hi>Adams</hi> perſon, without reſpect to his ofſpring; For <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; his ofſpring were onely conſidered in a priority of time and order, differing: <hi>Adam</hi> before them; but not in different ſtate of dignity, or favor with God; wherefore <hi>Adam</hi> did noe more then they did in, &amp; with him: but Chriſts perſon is more excellent, and more loved of God, then beleevers; &amp; did more for to injoy the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes then they: his Perſon, becomming <hi>incarnate,</hi> clayming them as due, and merriting them for the <hi>Elect:</hi> Therefore much more muſt it be, that we muſt firſt lay hold on Chriſts perſon before we can, on any promiſe; then we need be borne of <hi>Adam,</hi> before we can have title to any of his eſtate.</p>
                  <p>So that, it is a dangerous error: not to pitch by faith, on Chriſt, firſt; and then in the ſecond place, on the promiſes: Chriſt, in his <note place="margin">Pitch faith on Chriſt firſt, then on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</note> Perſon, Natures, Works, Merrits, muſt be firſt layed hold on: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it is true, that faith cannot lay hold on Chriſt, but in, and through a word, &amp; promiſe: Therefore my meaning is not to carry ye to Chriſt, without, or not by the word, &amp; promiſe; for without
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:113053:12"/> this, ye never can come to him, but meete with <hi>Satan,</hi> as an <hi>Angel</hi> of light: Ye muſt firſt cloſe by faith, with ſuch a word, &amp; promiſe in Scripture; as carries, &amp; exhibits Chriſt to you; but you muſt not firſt, before, through the word and promiſe ye have cloſed with Chriſt by faith; lay hold on &amp; apply the promiſes of any good things; as <hi>Heaven,</hi> pardon of <hi>Sinne,</hi> the <hi>Spirrit,</hi> or any <hi>Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus ye ſee how faith gives immediate union with Chriſt himſelfe: <note place="margin">Chriſt the fountaine of Joy in 2 Reſpects.</note> Now this Chriſt; I ſay, is the onely, &amp; immediate fountaine of all Joy: And that in Two Reſpects.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe, all the promiſes are <hi>in him</hi> onely, he is that one Sea, <note place="margin">Firſt, Bec. all promiſes are in him.</note> out of which doe iſſue all the ſprings of promiſes; wherefore in him muſt be all the ſprings of ioy &amp; comfort: as they are all ſaid to be <hi>in</hi> the Church, becauſe of his preſence there: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87. 7. Yea, &amp; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are better in him, &amp; much more ſtrong to comfort, then they are out of him; not onely becauſe he is the cheife, &amp; beſt promiſe himſelfe: his Perſon is better then all the promiſes, but alſo.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe, the promiſes <hi>in him,</hi> are in their roote, in him they live, <note place="margin">1.

                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:113053:13"/>
                  <p> Secondly, he is the immediate ſpringe of all joy, in an higher &amp; greater reſpect. <note place="margin">Secondly in reſpect that Chriſt is the Seate of that Joy which is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Becauſe, Jeſus Chriſt, is the ſeate &amp; receptacle of that joy which is communicable from God, to the creature; whatever comfort, or joy, God intended to make the creature pertaker of; he put it all into Jeſus Chriſt; (as the light of the world, is in the Sunne) as <hi>in him dwells the fullnes of the God-head bodily: Col.</hi> 2 9. ſo, with it dwells in him, all the fullnes of joy &amp; comfort: For it being all from God, it muſt be all in him, in whome dwells the <hi>God-heads fullnes,</hi> &amp; thence, come to us; as, becauſe all our light is from the Sunne, who conveyes his light to us, through the aire; therefore all the light we have, is in the aire; as <hi>in Chriſt are hid, all treaſures of wiſdome &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: Coloſ.</hi> 2. 3. ſo are, all treaſures, of joy &amp; comfort; as he is <hi>the light that inlightens every one, John.</hi> 1. 4. 9. ſo is he the comfort that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts every man, with any true comfort, God is indeed; the firſt original whence; but Chriſt is the immediate fountaine in which, is <note place="margin">Chriſt the immediate fountaine of all Joy.</note> all joy: <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>our life, is hid in God,</hi> but <hi>with Chriſt:</hi> So that indeed, Chriſt, is not onely the roote of all promiſes, but of a better comfort then the promiſes yeild; For, Chriſt is nearer to God, then the promiſes are, for he is of his nature, and the of ſpringe of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; Whereas the promiſes are the iſſue of his mind, &amp; will: he is the expreſſe image of the Fathers perſon; whereas the promiſes are but the expreſſion of his purpoſe: wherefore faith joyning the Soule, immediately to Chriſt: muſt needs greatly ſtrengthen againſt trouble, in that it derives the ſweeteſt, ſtrongeſt, &amp; moſt pure comforts.</p>
                  <p>Thus much for the <hi>Second Reaſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THIRDLY, Faith in Chriſt, is ſuch a ſpeciall <hi>antidote</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <note place="margin">3. Reaſon. Bec. Faith in Chriſt, brings the holy Ghoſt.</note> trouble; becauſe it brings the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> into the heart; in that it joynes the Soule to Chriſt, as to an <hi>head,</hi> or <hi>roote;</hi> whoſe Spirrit the holy Ghoſt, is; and ſo conveyes him into them; as the ingraſting an impe or ſcience, into a ſtock, derives the ſapp of that ſtock, into the ſcience: <hi>Gala.</hi> 3. 14. Now the holy Ghoſt, gives ſtrength to the Soule; as bancks doe to water, which of it ſelfe is weake, &amp; <note place="margin">Which ſtrengthens the Soule.</note> yeilds, &amp; falls aſunder; but ſtrenthened with bancks, becomes ſtrong, and mighty: Therefore <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 16. he beggs, <hi>their ſtrengthning by the Spirrit,</hi> not onely in the <hi>naturall ſpirrit;</hi> but in the <hi>Inner man;</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate ſpirrit, needs ſtrengthening from the holy Ghoſt; in that,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:113053:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> it alſo, is a creature; yea, &amp; beſids, or over &amp; above; the holy Ghoſt, ſometimes vouchſafes ſuch a preſence, &amp; reall ſence of himſelfe, &amp; of the things of Jeſus Chriſts; as fills the heart with glorious, and inexpreſſible joy (as the Sunne doth a roome with light, when it ariſeth) which is a joy, very differing from, and better then that which faith gives (of which, we ſpake before) being a glimpſe; &amp; firſt fruites of heaven, a preſence of God: whereby the heart is lifted up aboue the reach of any feares, or greife: which ſo bore up the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> in all their ſuffrings: as in the <hi>Acts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus Faith in Chriſt; uppon theſe grounds, gives ſtronger com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, <note place="margin">Thus faith in Chriſt gives &amp;c.</note> then any thing elſe, can doe: And faith in Chriſt, doth it more, then faith in God: That is; faith in Chriſt, as come in the <hi>flesh,</hi> yeilds ſtronger comfort, then faith in God promiſing Chriſt: becauſe through Chriſt come; is that actually done, which is the meritorious cauſe &amp; ground of conveyance of all commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, and comfort from him; Wherefore more muſt be conveyed, then when, this was but to be done, and in the promiſe; Therefore now, God diſpenſeth more of the <hi>Spirrit,</hi> and gives clearer <hi>revelations</hi> of Chriſt; then ever he did before.</p>
                  <p>So that, as it is ſaid of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that their converſion was an <hi>hiden miſterye</hi> before: though it yet was knowne, darkely; Even ſo the <hi>miſterye</hi> of Chriſt his <hi>Perſon, Righteouſnes, Merrits: &amp;c.</hi> was not knowne before his comming, in compariſon of what, it now is,; nor the <hi>priviledges</hi> by him; wherefore there could not be ſo much comfort then, as now may be:</p>
                  <p>Chriſt in the <hi>flesh</hi> (come) is called Gods arme <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 1. becauſe he, thereby, ſtrengethneth himſelfe to give us more grounds of comfort; and ſtrengthneth our hearts, to take more comfort, then every any, before Chriſts comming, could have: Therefore the <hi>Arke</hi> (which did tipify Chriſt, is called the <hi>Arke</hi> of Gods ſtrength <hi>Pſal</hi> 78. 61. <hi>&amp;</hi> 132. 8.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, when ever troubles aſſaile you that are beleevers, fly preſently to Chriſt, even to him in the word, and promiſe, <note place="margin">In troubles. fly to Chriſt</note> which holds him forth in his Perſon, Natures, Workes, Offices; and leane thereon; And fly not firſt, or onely to the particular promiſes, of good things; to theſe in the ſecond place, goe by faith, but to Chriſt, in the firſt place.</p>

                  <p> To pitch faith on God, &amp; the promiſes, is ſo to doe, as they did that were Jewes, before Chriſts comming: but to pitch your faith on Chriſt: is the Chriſtian way: It is folly &amp; unkindnes, ſince God hath given us his <hi>Sonne,</hi> to leane <hi>firſt</hi> on; &amp; his word in the <hi>ſecond</hi> place: which they had not of old: that yet wee doe it not, ye doe <note place="margin">Elſe you ſlight him, and Gods mercy in g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Second Caution is this; that though ye uſe your ſelves, &amp; put forth <note place="margin">2.

               <p>This is <hi>demonſtrated</hi> in Foure Perticulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Chriſt</hi> could not beare that theſe <hi>Beleevers,</hi> ſhould <hi>be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled:</hi> but forbids it, and by many <hi>Directions,</hi> and <hi>Arguments,</hi> fortifies <note place="margin">For 1.</note> them againſt it: So ſoone as he perceived <hi>trouble</hi> begine to ariſe in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; <note place="margin">He could not beare their being troubled.

                  <hi>He</hi> abounds &amp; ouerflowes with care to prevent &amp; remove it: Even as a tender Mother, who is reſtles in carefullnes to eaſe hir Child ſo ſoone as it is any way troubled: And this <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> fatther appeares in the reſt of this, &amp; the following <hi>Chapters:</hi> In which by many words; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine &amp; againe he diſcovers, that <hi>his bowels</hi> greatly moved whith the ſight of <hi>their trouble: He</hi> indeed ſhewing much more <hi>trouble of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion</hi> for them, then <hi>they had trouble of perplexity;</hi> as the tender Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers troubles for the Child, are oft greater, &amp; more, then the Childes, which cauſe them, becauſe of hir aboundance of bowels: Yet farther.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>He</hi> was thus taken up <hi>with trouble</hi> about <hi>their trouble,</hi> then <note place="margin">2.

It was <hi>his owne Perſonall trouble;</hi> which uſeth to ingroſſe all the care, that is in man, for himſelfe, though men can be troubled for others, when they are free themſelves, yet hardly when they are in trouble themſelves: Yea, and this <hi>trouble</hi> of <hi>Chriſts owne,</hi> was greater, then theirs, for theirs was much of it groundles, &amp; immaginary, &amp; ſuch as might be eſcaped (as ye have ſeene before) but <hi>Chriſts</hi> was all, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and ſuch as muſt be indured; &amp; it was the heavieſt burden as ever was, or could be layed on a creature; alſo it was at hand, he had ſett foote on its borders, &amp; toucht the brime of that <hi>Sea</hi> into which he was to be plunged; it was nearer then theirs, for theirs was but to follow on <hi>his:</hi> Now the preſence and approch in ſight of ſo great a trouble to ones ſelfe, how doth it uſe to ingroſſe an whole man, that he can mind no friends trouble elſe; as the <hi>Diſciples</hi> were ſo overcome with <hi>their owne</hi> loſſe by <hi>Chriſt his departure</hi> from <hi>them,</hi> as <hi>they</hi> could not mind <hi>him,</hi> and <hi>his trouble,</hi> not for an houre: Yet farther.</p>

               <p> Thirdly, <hi>He</hi> was thus taken up with <hi>trouble</hi> about <hi>their trouble,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3.

               <p>Fourthly, <hi>He</hi> was thus taken up with <hi>their troubles,</hi> though <hi>he</hi> knew <note place="margin">4.
