            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>For, as the Covenant of Works was made with <hi>Adam;</hi> &amp; in, &amp; <note place="margin">The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t of grace made with ChriÅ¿t, and in him, to his leede.</note> through him, with thoÅ¿e who came out of him: So the Covenant of Grace, is made with ChriÅ¿t (therefore called the <hi>Second Adam)</hi> &amp; in, &amp; through him, with all that come out of him, &amp; by faith are borne of him: and it is more neceÅ¿Å¿ary to be firÅ¿t made one with ChriÅ¿ts perÅ¿on, before we can have claime to the promiÅ¿es: then it was to be one with, &amp; of <hi>Adam,</hi> before we could inherite from him; becauÅ¿e the promiÅ¿es of Grace, are more confind firÅ¿t to ChriÅ¿ts perÅ¿on, &amp; that without the perÅ¿on of the <hi>Elect:</hi> then the Covenant of Works, was to <hi>Adams</hi> perÅ¿on, without reÅ¿pect to his ofÅ¿pring; For <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; his ofÅ¿pring were onely conÅ¿idered in a priority of time and order, differing: <hi>Adam</hi> before them; but not in different Å¿tate of dignity, or favor with God; wherefore <hi>Adam</hi> did noe more then they did in, &amp; with him: but ChriÅ¿ts perÅ¿on is more excellent, and more loved of God, then beleevers; &amp; did more for to injoy the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿es then they: his PerÅ¿on, becomming <hi>incarnate,</hi> clayming them as due, and merriting them for the <hi>Elect:</hi> Therefore much more muÅ¿t it be, that we muÅ¿t firÅ¿t lay hold on ChriÅ¿ts perÅ¿on before we can, on any promiÅ¿e; then we need be borne of <hi>Adam,</hi> before we can have title to any of his eÅ¿tate.</p>
                  <p>So that, it is a dangerous error: not to pitch by faith, on ChriÅ¿t, firÅ¿t; and then in the Å¿econd place, on the promiÅ¿es: ChriÅ¿t, in his <note place="margin">Pitch faith on ChriÅ¿t firÅ¿t, then on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿es.</note> PerÅ¿on, Natures, Works, Merrits, muÅ¿t be firÅ¿t layed hold on: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it is true, that faith cannot lay hold on ChriÅ¿t, but in, and through a word, &amp; promiÅ¿e: Therefore my meaning is not to carry ye to ChriÅ¿t, without, or not by the word, &amp; promiÅ¿e; for without

                  <p> SECONDLY, It is <hi>DeÅ¿cribed</hi> by <hi>Its Relation to God; It is Gods HouÅ¿e</hi> Å¿o called, Both becauÅ¿e <hi>He made it: Heb.</hi> 11. 16.

                  <p>FOURTHLY, It is <hi>DiÅ¿cribed,</hi> by <hi>Its Å¿peciall Relation</hi> to <hi>ChriÅ¿t,</hi> though it be <hi>God the Fathers HouÅ¿e,</hi> yet <hi>He is ChriÅ¿ts Father,</hi> and Å¿o it is <hi>ChriÅ¿t his Inheritance,</hi> and <hi>Beleevers Inheritance;</hi> As 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. in that, <hi>They</hi> be <hi>One</hi> with <hi>ChriÅ¿t, Sonnes, &amp; Heires;</hi> InÅ¿omuch that theÅ¿e <hi>DiÅ¿ciples,</hi> had they loved him as they Å¿hould, would be glad of his departure, Å¿ince he went but to his <hi>Father; John.</hi> 14. 28.</p>
                  <p>FIFTLY, It is <hi>DiÅ¿cribed,</hi> by <hi>Its Capeablenes</hi> of <hi>Them,</hi> and Å¿o of <hi>All Beleevers</hi> (for <hi>He Å¿peakes</hi> to theÅ¿e <hi>Eleaven</hi> in the <hi>Names of All,</hi> as ye heard before) there are in it <hi>many ManÅ¿ions:</hi> It were noe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, to heare of its <hi>Excellency,</hi> if it could not receive us, though <hi>God</hi> dwel there, yet the Creature alÅ¿o may; For <hi>He</hi> is now <hi>Emmanuel, God with <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>s:</hi> And many, not a few, (though Comparatively they be a <hi>Little Flocke Luke.</hi> 12. 32.) and many for Å¿ome, not for all, and that a Å¿ett number, for it is <hi>Prepared for Beleevers, Heb.</hi> 11. 16.

                  <p>Now the <hi>Truth</hi> of all this <hi>DeÅ¿cription</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> is ratified by an <hi>Argument</hi> taken from <hi>HimÅ¿elfe (If it were not Å¿o I would have told you) He</hi> was their <hi>Freind,</hi> came from <hi>Heaven</hi> to <hi>Reveale its Secrets, He is the faithfull &amp; true Witnes,</hi> therefore could not, but deale truely with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Amplified</hi> by his <hi>ConÅ¿umation</hi> of this his <hi>Preparation:</hi> As he prepares a <hi>Place</hi> for them; So he will bring them into that <hi>Place:</hi> Which that he may doe, being now gone, he muÅ¿t come againe: <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> will come from <hi>Heaven,</hi> to fetch <hi>Beleevers</hi> unto <hi>Heaven;</hi> he will not Å¿end for them, but come for them; which makes their acceÅ¿Å¿e to <hi>Heaven</hi> the more glorious, in that they Å¿hall be fetcht thither by <hi>Christ;</hi> Which is done, both in regard of <hi>HimÅ¿elfe,</hi> that he may have the <hi>Glory</hi> of judging the World, both <hi>Beleevers,</hi> and Unbeleevers; And in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of them, becauÅ¿e they are <hi>his body &amp; Å¿pouÅ¿e;</hi> and he will come to them therefore to <hi>marry them,</hi> and <hi>joyne them to HimÅ¿elfe;</hi> this is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diÅ¿cription of Heaven, by the manner of their <hi>Enterance</hi> into it, Even by <hi>ChriÅ¿t his glorious Comming</hi> from Heaven, to <hi>fetch</hi> them thither.</p>
                  <p>LASTLY, <hi>He</hi> further <hi>Amplifies</hi> it, by a <hi>DiÅ¿cription</hi> of the <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Place,</hi> by <hi>Its Communion with Him;</hi> They Å¿hall be <hi>taken to him,</hi>
